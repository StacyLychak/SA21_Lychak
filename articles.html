                <p>Coffee aroma is responsible for all coffee flavor attributes other than the mouthfeel and sweet,
                    salt, bitter, and sour
                    taste attributes that are perceived by the tongue. Therefore, it might be said that coffee aroma is
                    the most important
                    attribute to specialty coffee. Even instant coffee has the components responsible for stimulation of
                    our taste buds. The
                    difference, however, is that instant coffee lacks most of the aromatic volatile compounds causing a
                    dramatic decrease in
                    the overall coffee flavor.
                    <br></br>
                    Always inhale your coffee before taking a sip. Your taste buds can identify the four basic tastes –
                    sour, bitter, sweet,
                    and salty. On the other hand, the nose can detect thousands of aromas. So, cup your hand over your
                    cup and hold it close
                    to your nose. Take a delightful smell and identify the scented undertones.
                    <br></br>
                    The taste buds are limited when it comes to detecting flavor profiles. Thus, professionals use the
                    aroma to identify
                    hints of flavors in coffee. For instance, you’d be able to smell citrusy, floral, and fruity
                    undertones in your coffee.
                    These can be easily missed out when you rely on your tastebuds for taste identification. Because of
                    the crucial part of
                    the coffee aroma, smelling the brew before taking a sip is the first step to coffee tasting. Doing
                    this best detects the
                    accenting flavors in your brew.

                <p>There are hundreds of ways to enjoy a cup of coffee. A simple adjustment in the brew can instantly
                    transform its taste.
                    But why does coffee taste so different? The things that make coffee taste different are due to its
                    ingredient, and
                    partly, it is also about its science.

                    One key factor that addresses the question of what makes coffee taste different is the beans'
                    origin. Each growing
                    region renders a specific trait or characteristics to your coffee and enhances its flavor profile.

                    For instance, Kenya and Sumatra are popular origins of coffee, and they have different climates for
                    growing their beans.
                    <br></br>
                    When it comes to the taste of coffee, professionals with refined palate will tell you that there is
                    no single coffee
                    taste. The use of the coffee taster wheel is but to guide you in coming up with a description.
                    Coffee taste is
                    influenced by its origin, processing, roasting quality, and preparations. To perceive the taste
                    using the taste buds,
                    the Coffee Taste Chart, or the Coffee Tasting Wheel, starts with four basic tastes – sour, salty,
                    sweet, and bitter. As
                    it spans outwards, it follows your exploration of the flavors you identify in your cup.
                    <br></br>
                    When reading through various coffee varieties, you may think that the descriptions are embellished,
                    confusing, or
                    exaggerated. But when you learn how to describe coffee tastes, you will be able to interpret these
                    words better. More
                    so, understanding how to describe coffee allows you to recognize the brew by merely taking a sip
                    from your cup. A
                    refined coffee taster will also be able to leave an accurate description of the taste of coffee
                    after thoroughly
                    enjoying your brew.

                <p>Do you desire strong coffee? Do you want the strongest coffee in the world? Do you think your coffee
                    is weak?
                    The idea of strong coffee is probably the most culturally communicated desire. “How do you like your
                    coffee?” “Strong,
                    and black.” “I don’t care how you make the coffee as long as it’s strong!” And of course the bevy of
                    businesses
                    representing ‘the strongest coffee.’ It’s one of the most demanded things by coffee drinkers
                    everywhere. Yet, there’s
                    seemingly no consistent (or accurate) connection to reality when it comes to individuals knowing
                    what ‘strong coffee’
                    really is.
                    <br></br>
                    If you search online to learn about strong coffee, you’ll find many people discussing various
                    interpretations. In the
                    coffee industry circles, those who subscribe to the technically correct approach to all things
                    coffee will talk about
                    ‘strong coffee’ as a myth, or a fallacy. It would be easy to follow this route simply because
                    ‘strength’ has a technical
                    definition which has little bearing on the reality of people’s experience. That is, what all the
                    other interpretations
                    of strength in coffee refer to have merely a tertiary connection with the actual technical
                    definition.
                    <br></br>
                    Strong coffee is high in caffeine.
                    Strong coffee is darker and ‘bolder’ (another trip word). Strong coffee is a higher intensity of
                    flavor.Strong coffee
                    gives you a bigger kick, a bigger reaction, it smacks you in the face. Regardless of the above
                    perceptions, by and large
                    people approach strong coffee by looking for roasted coffee which is ‘stronger.’ This is where the
                    technical definition
                    and reality do not meet. If strong coffee really is a factor of having greater % of coffee solids in
                    your cup, then the
                    roast or bean matters not at all. You would simply just brew with more coffee using the same amount
                    of water, and you’d
                    have strong(er) coffee.
